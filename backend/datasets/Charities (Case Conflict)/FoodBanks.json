For over 30 years, we've been working with grocers, food companies, Ohio farmers, the USDA, and community partners to obtain food and distribute it to our partner agencies. The partnerships we share with more than 650 partner agencies and community organizations across our 20-county service area is crucial to our mission. It's these food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, after-school programs, and senior housing sites that ensure the food we deliver gets to the people who need it most. Together, we distribute enough food to provide 121,625 meals for food insecure Ohioans every day. ",

In pursuit of this mission, Community Harvest solicits surplus food and grocery donations from the food industry, and through community food drives. The food is sorted, inspected for quality, and readied for distribution to the hungry via a member agency network of 460 plus churches and social service agencies. These agencies include such vital services as emergency food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, rehabilitation centers, youth and older adult programs.",

Inspired to end the waste, she began forming liaisons with local vendors and seeking shelters that could use good, wholesome food to feed needy and impoverished families, children and elderly. Food Finders was quickly formed, and from there the kitchen-table business grew into what is now a multi-regional food bank that helps provide daily meals to more than 280 agencies and shelters throughout Southern California. Food Finders, which has grown to 9 employees and more than 300 volunteers, has rescued more than 121 million pounds of food to date, in addition to referring thousands of families to local shelters and agencies where meals are provided.",

KLF is the largest charitable food distribution system in Kalamazoo County. We work hard to promote a hunger-free community through programs and advocacy work.",

Sixty-seven percent of all households served have a monthly income of $1,200 or less and 59% have children under the age of 18 living in the home. VEAP's four programs--Food, Children and Youth, Transportation and Social Services--can help avoid a financial crisis such as loss of housing. In 2014, with the help of over 1,700 volunteers, VEAP served over 19,000 unduplicated individuals representing an increase of more than 2,000 over 2013. This is due in part to VEAP's new facility, which opened in January 2014. VEAP's tenant is Hennepin County's Human Services and Public Health Department. This innovative public-private partnership leverages the unique resources of both agencies and focuses on the collective client outcomes.",

Donations from churches, clubs, businesses and individuals cover the costs of processing, packaging and freezing the meat.

This nutritious, low fat, high protein meat is then distributed and/or cooked by hundreds of community agencies.",

SHFB operates an Emergency Food Box program in Davidson County that helps individuals and families with emergency food needs. SHFB's Children's Feeding Programs provide low-income children with a nutritious evening meal or a BackPack bag of food for the weekend when school meals are not available. The Middle Tennessee's Table program rescues food products from grocery stores and distributes them to partner agencies in our 46-county service area. The Project Preserve Program produces and brokers millions of pounds of food for distribution to agencies in Middle Tennessee as well as to food banks across the country.",

The Food Bank distributes over four million pounds of donated and purchased food each year to 75,000 people, working through 80 nonprofit partner agencies. These partners are essential in providing food throughout such a vast 19 county area, covering over 34,000 square miles of the Permian Basin and Big Bend. The Food Bank serves as a clearinghouse to solicit, store, inspect, and repack surplus and purchased food for distribution. We are a member of Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief network, and a member of the Texas Food Bank Network. We also run Kids Caf\u00e9, which provides healthy, nutritious afternoon snacks and evening meals to needy children in after-school child care programs.",
