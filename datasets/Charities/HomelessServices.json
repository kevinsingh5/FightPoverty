As ideas for a more unified community resource center emerged, Preble Street launched a unique collaborative partnership of private and public agencies working together to meet the immediate and long-term needs of the homeless and low-income residents of Greater Portland, consolidating three soup kitchens, a food pantry, the City of Portland Homeless Healthcare Clinic, a day shelter, social services, a housing location program, and a homelessness prevention program.",

Second, MCH works to ensure adequate and appropriate shelter if homelessness is unavoidable. Third, MCH advocates for long-term solutions to the housing crisis, promoting government support for income and housing resources so that all Massachusetts residents can obtain and maintain safe, affordable housing.

Today, in addition to our street outreach, we provide case management services at St. John's Soup Kitchen in Newark, open our doors to Summit Neighbors in Need every Friday, and provide new backpacks and school supplies for more than 1,000 children eligible for free and reduced lunch in Summit and to sheltered children in Newark and Irvington.",

Our success is measured not only by the health impact of miles run, but also by how many individuals obtain education, employment and housing. Back on My Feet recruits members (individuals experiencing homelessness) at homeless and residential facilities around the country and begins with a commitment to run three days a week in the early morning. After 30 days in the program, members with 90% attendance earn the opportunity to move into the second phase of the program called Next Steps, which provides educational support, job training programs, employment partnership referrals and housing resources. Almost 80% of individuals who start the program move into Next Steps.",

We currently offer an after school program for youth K-12 grades, an emergency food pantry, clothing bank, and emergency relief program.

Security means a housing environment where residents' personal safety is a priority. Dignity means a housing environment that allows residents to develop personal, social, and economic strengths. And community is a regular, predictable housing environment that offers a sense of family, while affirming the individual. We achieve our mission by maintaining 134 units of permanent supportive housing and 16 units of transitional housing in 6 buildings in Over-the-Rhine. Our model of housing is based on the belief that by addressing the root causes of homelessness, we can help an individual break the cycle of homelessness once he or she leaves Tender Mercies.",

CHUM began in 1973 when ten Central Hillside congregations pooled resources to assist low-income people in Duluth. The organizational goals are to provide basic needs services for homeless and marginalized members of our community while working to effect changes which will eliminate the need for our services. CHUM provides core social safety net programs which include emergency food, shelter, advocacy, and outreach to over 7,000 hungry, homeless and low-income people each year. Housing advocates and street case managers provide stabilization services through case management programs for homeless or imminently homeless families and single adults. CHUM's congregational outreach and community organizing efforts center on social justice issues relating to homelessness, poverty and employment.",

Since then, Sheffield Place has assisted more than 1000 families in making the difficult journey from homelessness to self-sufficiency. What makes Sheffield Place unique is the commitment to Trauma Informed Care and trauma recovery as the first step in healing; the intense focus on mental health and addiction recovery services delivered by licensed, master's level therapists; the exclusive focus on homeless mothers and children; the length of stay (averages 3 months); the delivery of all services onsite where the families live; and the provision of ongoing case management and other supportive services for as long as necessary once the families transition from the shelter to permanent housing in the community.",

Today in the Nation's Capital, as in so many other areas of the United States, there is a growing dearth of safe, affordable housing. As the District of Columbia is in the midst of near-record level growth and development, the availability of quality affordable housing is threatened like never before. But thanks to so many partners and supporters, Jubilee Housing exists as an alternative to current trends and market forces. Neighborhoods and communities can preserve affordable options for all of their residents. Affordable housing and supportive community can be sustained even in the most stressed housing markets.",

To achieve its mission, the organization pursues three main strategies: impact litigation; policy advocacy; and public education. The Law Center strives to place homelessness in the larger context of poverty. By taking this approach, the organization aims to address homelessness as a very visible manifestation of deeper causes, including the shortage of affordable housing, insufficient income, and inadequate social services.",

The Haven has grown to accommodate an average of 90 men and women in its facilities. Programs are free of charge to men and women who need help.",

During its productive twenty year history, CRN has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling its mission and vision statements working with 134 shelters and group homes throughout metro-Atlanta, serving over 3,000 children each day, and 6,000 each year. While children are our main focus, we also realize that assisting the mother is usually the best way to help the child. Programs are therefore directed towards both children and their mothers to ease their transition through homelessness. Education is CRN's main focus. We provide new book bags filled with school supplies, do one on one weekly mentoring during the school year, and award New Hope Scholarships to deserving students.",

We work within a continuum of care alongside churches, individuals, agencies, as well as local, state, and federal government as we provide a combination of relief and long-term solutions to poverty and homelessness in our region.",

The Women's and Children's Shelter provides food, clothing, shelter and education to women and children in need for both long and short-term care. There is also a separate apartment for families in need whether it is a man with young children or a mom with teenage boys.",

One must be shown the love of God before being told of His love. Food, a hot shower and clean clothes and safe shelter allow the seed of life to be sown. Our desire is to see a broken individual transform into a new person and ultimately re-engage with society and then share God's love with others. Gateway Rescue Mission offers life changing hope in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to homeless men, women and children through programs to deliver food, shelter, counseling and discipleship.",

We believe God has called us to break the cycle of poverty in the lives of those we serve. Poverty is a destructive lifestyle that sets limits and boundaries on an individual that prevents that individual from reaching their full potential. To break the cycle of poverty, we must build relationships that are based on biblical principles. We build relationships with individuals through the various ministries by becoming involved in their lifestyles which ultimately lead them to making healthy choices. CCC began as a clinic in 1971 and eventually became a ministry with a broad range of services.",

Our programs promote family stability, teach skills to break the poverty cycle, and build a strong sense of community in the process.",

Over the years, we've seen the city's boundaries change and the needs of our community grow. As a result of the increased need, we've grown, expanded our services and programs, and have spread out into three different locations. Every week, through our member churches and faithful volunteers and staff, we provide much-needed food, clothing, help with utilities and rent, medical assistance . . . and most importantly, spiritual care and emotional support. The need is great.",

Denver Rescue Mission is a leader in building and strengthening the community; one person at a time. Founded in 1892, the Mission is the oldest, full-service, faith-based non-profit organization serving the poor and homeless in the Rocky Mountain region. The Mission has four core strategies for addressing homelessness: emergency services, rehabilitation, transitional programs and community outreach. Through meals, shelter, restroom and shower access, health services, and laundry facilities our homeless neighbors who are struggling can access these basic services. The Mission's New Life Program is offered for men and women to overcome addictions and hardships. For working individuals and families experiencing homelessness the Mission offers a transitional program as well as mentoring programs to help them reach self-sufficiency. Lastly, people who are struggling to put food on the table and pay bills can utilize community outreaches including a food pantry, clothing, furniture, diapers and hygiene distribution.",

The Mission started with a homeless shelter for men and women. A few weeks later a community lunch program was started and today we have four shelters, five programs for men and women, a domestic violence shelter for women and children, holiday meals, and Bible clubs for children five times a year. Last year we were able to feed over 35,000 individuals thanks to the financial generosity of our donors. Our newest addition is the Crossroads Family Fellowship Center which was dedicated February 18, 2009.",
